### Breast Cancer Tumor Classification using Machine Learning
This project develops a machine learning pipeline for classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. It utilizes LASSO for feature selection and employs classifiers such as KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to optimize predictive accuracy, aiding in early detection.
